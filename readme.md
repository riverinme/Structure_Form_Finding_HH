**To find the shape/form of a highly geometry nonlinear structre.**

Here is one example.

Here is how it looks in SAP2000 with a external point load assigned,

...and the initial deformation under pre-stressing.

The deformation under the point load is shown belowï¼Œ

...and the load case defination.

If the pre case is fogotten, the deformation will increase like

To wrap up, the found geometry and pre-loading(prestressing and/or selfweight) shall be both included in the model.
